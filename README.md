# Telegram bot for notifying of job changes on Indeed

After the initial search of jobs based on user criteria any new jobs are sent as a message by telegram bot every 5 minutes

## I wanna use this. How can I?

Due to the nature of web scraping supporting multiple users adds a lot of complexity. Through building this I have already run into instances of being temporarily blocked by indeed. It is best to deploy it yourself or run a local instance on an old machine 24/7. A VPN is recommended to be used.

## future goals:

- change this to allow for a cron job deployment.
